# Servy - The One Bot to Rule Them All

Welcome to **Servy**, the Discord bot with the sole purpose of making you feel like you’re doing something productive while actually just automating laziness. Brought to you by the **Zwaggerboyz**, a group of high-functioning procrastinators who thought, “Why not build a bot that handles our Minecraft server and maybe plays music… and possibly does our taxes?”

## What is Servy?

Good question! **Servy** is a bot that currently exists to:

- **Control a Minecraft server** because typing commands manually is soooo 2020.
- Occasionally crash for no reason (it's a feature, not a bug).
- Be a general playground for anyone brave (or bored) enough to add features.

If you think this bot will save you time or improve your gaming experience, you’re **probably right**. But don’t hold your breath.

## How to Contribute

Feel free to mess with **Servy**! Add your own commands, create bugs, make it play music, or have it remind you to feed your goldfish. This project is as open-source as our commitment to actual software development (which is… questionable at best). Fork it, break it, fix it—just don’t blame us when the bot spontaneously sings "Never Gonna Give You Up" at 3 a.m. in your Discord server.

## Features (aka the stuff it does for now)

1. **Minecraft Server Control**  
   Because we're too lazy to open a terminal every time we want to stop a creeper party.

2. **Potential Music Bot** (coming soon™)  
   We haven’t figured this one out yet, but we're sure someone will, eventually. Maybe. No pressure.

3. **Extensibility**  
   Want it to send memes, tell you the weather, or order pizza? Go ahead. Just don't expect us to do it for you.

4. **Random Crash Generator**  
   Look, it's not a bug, it’s a chaotic art form. Sometimes Servy just needs to take a nap. Embrace the randomness.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository. Or don’t. Whatever.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darwom/servy.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies. You don’t need to understand them, just trust the process.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create your `.env` file with your Discord token and other secrets. Secrets. Intriguing, right? (Don’t worry, it’s just boring bot stuff.)

   ```
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token_here
   RCON_PASSWORD=your_rcon_password_here
   ```

4. Start the bot like a professional:
   ```bash
   python3 servy.py
   ```

## License

Servy is under the "Do Whatever You Want" license. If you break it, it’s your fault. If you fix it, well, congrats! You’re the new unofficial maintainer.

## Support

Support? Ha! You’re funny. For questions, complaints, or if you just want to vent about life, send a message to any of the **Zwaggerboyz**. We’ll probably respond, eventually, unless we’re too busy watching YouTube tutorials on "How to Actually Write a README."

## Credits

- **Servy** - A bot with a purpose (kinda).
- **Zwaggerboyz** - A team that doesn’t really understand Git but pushes to main anyway.
- **ChatGPT** - For generating this README and 99% of the bot’s code.
